I am excited to share my recent research on **how age and gender affect
respiratory patterns in healthy individuals**, published at **EMBC 2024**. This
study investigates respiratory variability using data from different breathing
patterns and explores the effects of **age-related and gender-specific
differences** in respiratory function.

## Abstract

Chronic respiratory diseases are a significant global health concern.
Monitoring respiratory patterns can play a crucial role in early disease
detection and treatment. Our study analyzed respiratory variability in **two
age groups** (young adults and middle-aged adults) using **pneumotachographs
and inductive plethysmographic bands** to assess how factors like age and
gender influence respiratory behavior.

## Key Findings

- **Stronger Correlation with Combined Signals**: The sum of thoracic and
abdominal bands showed the highest correlation with respiratory volume,
outperforming individual bands.
- **Gender Differences in Adults**: Gender-related differences were more
pronounced in **spontaneous breathing**, with notable distinctions in the
expiratory phase.
- **Age-Related Variability**: Older subjects exhibited greater variability in
**expiratory phase parameters**, suggesting reduced adaptability with age.
- **Clinical Relevance**: These findings highlight the importance of **age and
gender considerations** in respiratory monitoring and potential diagnostic
applications.

## Methodology

The study involved two groups:

- **G1 (Younger Group)**: 23 subjects (21 ± 1 years old)
- **G2 (Adult Group)**: 49 subjects (52 ± 6 years old)

Each participant underwent a structured **breathing protocol** consisting of:

- Spontaneous breathing
- Nasal breathing
- Mouth breathing
- Shallow and deep breathing

The respiratory signals were processed using **Butterworth filters**, signal
integration, and **cross-correlation techniques** for feature extraction. Key
metrics such as **inspiratory time (Tins), expiratory time (Texp), breathing
duration (TTot), and tidal volume (VT)** were analyzed statistically.

## Results

- The **sum of thoracic and abdominal signals** provided the highest correlation with respiratory volume (**r > 0.9**).
- Expiratory variability increased with age, particularly in basal breathing.
- Gender-related differences were more significant in the **adult group**, mainly affecting inspiratory and expiratory phases.

## Conclusion

Our research provides insights into how **respiratory patterns change with age
and gender**. The study emphasizes the importance of personalized approaches to
respiratory monitoring, particularly for **clinical applications in pulmonology
and critical care**.
